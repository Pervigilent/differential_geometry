# Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces
### First Edition by Alfred Gray (Edited by Stewart Nash)

## Introduction

Alfred Gray wrote <i>Modern Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces</i> as a differential geometry textbook which uses Mathematica. The book is extremely good; however, I believe that there are problems inherent with its use of Mathematica as a language. Mathematica is not as popular as Matlab and not commonly used among engineers. Therefore, I think it is very valuable to translate this work into Matlab to allow it to be used among scientists and engineers. I also hope that some mathematicians will become more familiar with Matlab through this effort, as it will allow them to communicate and work more effectively with scientists and engineers. This will be very helpful to those mathematicians who have already read the book and are looking to translate their knowledge into Matlab.

I have ready access to the (First Edition)[https://smile.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Surfaces-Textbooks-Mathematics/dp/0849378729/] which I will attempt to finish first. However, I will attempt to update to the (Third Edition)[https://smile.amazon.com/Differential-Geometry-Mathematica-Textbooks-Mathematics/dp/1584884487/] if I can finish the first edition and justify spending 100 dollars to buy the new edition. I view this repository as a gateway to other mathematical repositories. I definitely plan to do partial differential equations in the future. And perhaps I will make a repository for complex analysis after that.

If you have any questions, comments, suggestions, or concerns, you can email me at pervigilent@gmail.com. I hope to integrate this repository with an artificial intelligence and computational biology organization which I will link to on this site and www.pervigilent.com in the future.
